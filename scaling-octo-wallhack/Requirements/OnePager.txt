This project suppose to be some research work about possibility of using neural 
networks in task of compressing video data.

The main goal is to receive working application which receiving some video file 
or video files as input will create file or files which later could be replayed 
with the same program and output video should be very similar to what was in 
input.

Research part will include comparison with currently widely used video coders
in following measurements: compress ratio (compressed file size/original file 
size), performance (time required to compress few fixed length video files).
Note, that different types of videos should be tested: featured films, videos 
with a lot of static data (videos recorded by security cameras), cartoons, 
videos recorded by car recorder.

As core of program will be used Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with multiple
layers. As input RBM receives frame, then calculate it's layers
states in order from input to last and the state of the last layer is saved.
Then next input frame is used.

Restoring original video input given set of last layers occurs backward way - 
receiving last layer state and calculating first layer which is the restored 
frame.

As output system should save all parameters of RBM and all states of last 
layers. In order to save space, it will worth having one RBM for few video files.

The secondary research task is to check how well the product will use RBM 
obtained on one set of videos on other videos, not used in training.
